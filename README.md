Data [![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-ruby.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)
----
A terminal data-controller with dynamic auto-complete features, that is built with ruby. You may want to even store credentials such as Bank Account / Password details - however, do this is at your own risk as anyone who has your unlocked linux machine / has SSH-access to your linux machine can navigate to the `info/` directory generated by the codes, to view all the data. 

INSTALLING REQUIRED GEMS
------------------------
<br> (1) `gem install json` 
<br> (2) `gem install terminal-table`

MAKING THE SCRIPT WORK
----------------------
- [x] Type the following commands on a terminal : `cd ~/; git clone git@github.com:athityakumar/data.git`
- [x] Now type this in the terminal : `gedit ~/.bashrc`
- [x] The below schell-script can also be found in this repository as `CopyThis.sh`. Copy paste this into the `.bashrc` file :  
  <pre>function Data 
  <br>{ 
  <br>cd ~/data; 
  <br>ruby main.rb $1 $2 $3;
  <br>cd ~/;
  <br>. ~/data/Data; 
  <br>}
  <br>if test -f "/data/Data"; 
  <br>then
  <br>    . ~/data/Data;
  <br>else
  <br>    cd ~/data;
  <br>    ruby main.rb Init;
  <br>    cd ~/;
  <br>    . ~/data/Data
  <br>fi
  </pre>
- [x] Now, open a new terminal. Have the auto-completion files of `Data` been initialised? Great!
- [x] Type `D` and press `Tab`. Yay, it auto-completes to `Data`!  
- [x] Continue further by reading through the set of supported auto-complete commands.
